# Cassandra Administration [Video]
This is the code repository for [Cassandra Administration
 [Video]](https:utm_campaign=9781789952469), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/cassandra-administration-video). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This video course provides you with the necessary know-how to effectively administrate and perform operations in Cassandra. You will also get to know, from an architecture perspective, how Cassandra differs from traditional databases and other popular NoSQL databases.

The course starts off by showing you the steps to build your own cluster, and introduces you to the different use cases for Cassandra. Along the way, you will encounter caveats based on scenarios that may not be a good fit. After learning how to install Cassandra, you will learn how to use different monitoring tools and methods to import and export large amount of data. Next, primary and secondary indexes are explained to help you select the appropriate indexing that enables fast and efficient data lookup to respond to search and retrieval requests. Finally, you will use various tools to facilitate performance tuning, and conduct a stress test on a cluster, and interpret the performance results.

By the end of this course, you will have developed the required skills to install and set up any Cassandra cluster, along with administrating and managing daily operations easily.
